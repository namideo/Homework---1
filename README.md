For this homework assignment I deployed a web application to the best of my ability following the guidelines laid out in the assignment and as covered in class. Below is a breakdown of what I achieved in the assignment.

1. Added a title and arranged the elements within the "head" to be in the correct order.

2. Fixed a broken link in the html by assigning an "id."

3. Eliminated and replaced unnecessary div's and added a header, footer, and sections as to be more in line with semantic structure. 

4. Added "alt" attributes to each of the image elements. 

5. Created space between the different sections and elements to make it easier to distinguish between each one.

6. Organized and condensed some of the css elements and commented on my changes. 

7. Checked that the web application's layout and links all appeared and functioned properly.

8. Created a new repository within GitHub. 

9. Added, committed, and pushed my changes to my repository in GitHub. 

10. Uploaded my assignment to GitHubPages. 

11. Supplied a screenshot of the web application below.
